## Trunk-Based Development

Trunk-Based Development is a software development approach where all developers work on a single branch, often referred to as the "trunk" or "main" branch.

**How Trunk-Based Development Works:**

Single Main Branch: In trunk-based development, there is typically only one main branch where all development work takes place. This main branch reflects the current state of the project and is always kept in a deployable state.

Frequent Commits and Merges: Developers commit their changes directly to the main branch. This means that new features, bug fixes, and other changes are integrated into the main codebase as soon as they are ready.

Continuous Integration (CI): Automated tests are run on every commit to the main branch to ensure that the code remains stable and functional. 

**Guidelines for Working with the Main Branch**

**Pull Request Process**

Feature Branches: When working on a new feature or bug fix, create a feature branch off the main branch.
Pull Request Submission: Submit a pull request for review and approval once the changes are ready. Ensure that the pull request is linked to the corresponding issue or feature request.

Code Review: All pull requests must undergo code review by at least two team members. Reviewers should provide constructive feedback and ensure that the changes adhere to coding standards and best practices.
Automated Testing: Automated tests, including unit tests, integration tests, and any other relevant tests, should be run automatically as part of the pull request validation process.
