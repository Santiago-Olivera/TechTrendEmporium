## Trunk-Based Development

Trunk-Based Development is a software development approach where all developers work on a single branch, often referred to as the "trunk" or "main" branch.

**How Trunk-Based Development Works:**

Single Main Branch: In trunk-based development, there is typically only one main branch where all development work takes place. This main branch reflects the current state of the project and is always kept in a deployable state.

Temporal feature branches: also known as short-lived feature branches. In this approach, developers will create short-lived branches to work on a specific feature or change, then when they finish the develop on this branch, they will create a pull request to merge the new feature into the main branch.


**Guidelines for Working with the Main Branch**

**Pull Request Process**

Pull Request Submission: Submit a pull request for review and approval once the changes are ready. Ensure that the pull request is linked to the corresponding issue or feature request.

Code Review: All pull requests must undergo code review by at least two team members. Reviewers should provide constructive feedback and ensure that the changes adhere to coding standards and best practices.
